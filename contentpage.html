                        Video games have a dual and complex impact on youth mental health and social interactions, 
                        with both potential benefits and serious risks. The effects largely depend on the type of game, 
                        the amount of time spent playing, and the individual's pre-existing mental state.

                    <h5>
                        The effects on mental health can be either positive or negative. 
                        On the positive edge, video games can be a source of stress relief and can help some teens cope with anxiety. 
                        They can improve cognitive functions like problem-solving, attention, and memory. 
                        The rewarding feeling of completing a level or winning a game can also give a sense of accomplishment and boost 
                        a player's self-esteem.

                        However, excessive gaming, often leading to a behavioral addiction known as Internet Gaming Disorder (IGD), 
                        is linked to negative mental health outcomes. This can include increased rates of depression, anxiety, 
                        and aggression. The pressure from competitive gameplay and exposure to cyberbullying can also heighten stress levels. 
                        In addition, spending too much time gaming can lead to disrupted sleep patterns, which is a major risk factor for mental health issues. 
                        For some, gaming becomes an unhealthy form of escapism, allowing them to avoid real-life problems and emotions, which can exacerbate underlying issues.
